Backup of my progress with a PyQT word processor tutorial at https://www.binpress.com/building-text-editor-pyqt-1/

Improvements so far:

	•	added filename and path to status bar / warning if never saved
	•	off-white screen for less glare
	•	added keyboard shortcuts for bold, italic, underline
	•	can only paste in unformatted text
	•	constant on-screen word count
	•	removed annoying duplicate tool tips in status bar
	•	default font set to Helvetica instead of system font
	•	make only text area yellow, rest white background

Still to do:

	•	show when saved file is modified but not re-saved
	•	pre-select default font in font menu by name rather than guessing numbers
	•	remember / open last saved file
	•	save as plain text option
	•	paste formatted text option
	•	tidy status bar with fixed areas and red warning when not saved
